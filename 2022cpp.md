## Differentiate between static and runtime polymorphism

Polymorphism refers to the ability of a single entity, such as a variable, a function, or an object, to have multiple forms. There are two types of polymorphism: static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.

Static polymorphism, also known as compile-time polymorphism, occurs when the implementation of a polymorphic entity is determined at compile time. This is achieved through method overloading, which is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different signatures in the same class or subclass. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Calculator {
public:
  int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }

  int add(int a, int b, int c) {
    return a + b + c;
  }
};

int main() {
  Calculator c;
  std::cout << c.add(1, 2) << std::endl; // prints 3
  std::cout << c.add(1, 2, 3) << std::endl; // prints 6
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the add method is overloaded with two different signatures: add(int, int) and add(int, int, int). The appropriate add method will be called at runtime based on the number of arguments passed to it.

Dynamic polymorphism, also known as runtime polymorphism, occurs when the implementation of a polymorphic entity is determined at runtime. This is achieved through method overriding, which is the ability to define a method in a subclass that has the same signature as a method in the superclass. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Animal {
public:
  virtual void makeSound() {
    std::cout << "Some animal sound" << std::endl;
  }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
  void makeSound() override {
    std::cout << "Bark" << std::endl;
  }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
  void makeSound() override {
    std::cout << "Meow" << std::endl;
  }
};

int main() {
  Animal* a = new Animal();
  a->makeSound(); // prints "Some animal sound"
  delete a;

  a = new Dog();
  a->makeSound(); // prints "Bark"
  delete a;

  a = new Cat();
  a->makeSound(); // prints "Meow"
  delete a;

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the makeSound method is defined in the Animal class and is overridden in the Dog and Cat classes. When the makeSound method is called on an object of type Animal, the implementation in the Animal class will be used. However, if the object is of type Dog or Cat, the implementation in the subclass will be used instead. The appropriate makeSound method will be called at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

## What is Inline function? Explain with suitable example

An inline function is a function that is expanded in line at the point where it is called, rather than being called through the normal function call mechanism. In C++, inline functions are defined using the inline keyword.

Here is an example of an inline function in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

inline int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  std::cout << add(1, 2) << std::endl; // prints 3
  return 0;
}

```

In this example, the add function is defined as an inline function. When it is called in main, the code for the function is expanded in place, rather than being called through the function call mechanism. This can potentially improve the performance of the program, as it reduces the overhead of the function call.

However, there are a few things to consider when using inline functions. First, inline functions are generally only a good idea for short functions, as the expansion of the function code can increase the size of the generated object code. Second, inline functions are only a suggestion to the compiler, and the compiler is free to ignore the request and treat the function as a normal function. Finally, inline functions cannot be used for functions that contain loops or function calls, as these constructs cannot be expanded in line.

## Discuss the scope resolution operator with suitable example

The scope resolution operator, also known as the "double colon" operator (::), is a C++ operator that is used to access class members that have been defined outside the class definition. It is also used to specify which base class a member function or variable belongs to when there is ambiguity.

Here is an example of the scope resolution operator in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A {
public:
  static int x;
};

int A::x = 0; // define the static member x

int main() {
  A::x = 5; // use the scope resolution operator to access x
  std::cout << A::x << std::endl; // prints 5
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the static member x is defined outside the class definition, and the scope resolution operator is used to specify that x belongs to class A. The scope resolution operator is also used to access the value of x in the main function.

The scope resolution operator can also be used in the context of inheritance, to specify which base class a member function or variable belongs to. For example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class A {
public:
  void foo() { std::cout << "A::foo" << std::endl; }
};

class B : public A {
public:
  void foo() { std::cout << "B::foo" << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
  B b;
  b.foo(); // prints "B::foo"
  b.A::foo(); // prints "A::foo" using the scope resolution operator
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the class B overrides the foo function from the base class A. When the foo function is called on an object of type B, the implementation in B is used. However, the scope resolution operator can be used to specify that the foo function from the base class A should be called, rather than the one in B.

### Discuss the difference file mode with example

In C++, the fstream library provides classes that can be used to read from and write to files. These classes, fstream, ifstream, and ofstream, can be used to open a file in different modes, which determine how the file can be accessed.

Here are the four file modes that are supported by the fstream library:
