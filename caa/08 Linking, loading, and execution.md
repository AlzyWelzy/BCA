# Linking, loading, and execution

Linking, loading, and execution are three important stages in the process of running a program on a computer.

**Linking** is the process of combining multiple object files and libraries into a single executable file. Object files contain machine code and other information, such as symbol tables and debugging information. Libraries are collections of object files that can be linked into a program to provide additional functionality. Linking is typically performed by a linker, which resolves symbol references and combines the object files into a single executable.

**Loading** is the process of transferring the executable file from storage (such as a hard drive) into memory. This allows the program to be executed by the processor. The operating system (OS) is responsible for managing the loading of programs into memory.

**Execution** is the process of running the program. The processor fetches and executes instructions from the program's machine code, using the memory and other resources of the computer.

Linking, loading, and execution are important concepts in computer science because they describe the steps involved in running a program on a computer. Understanding these processes can help programmers to optimize the performance and efficiency of their programs, and to debug issues that may arise during execution.
