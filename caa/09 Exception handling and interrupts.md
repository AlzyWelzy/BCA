# Exception handling and interrupts

Exception handling is a mechanism for handling errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions are typically caused by unexpected or exceptional circumstances, such as a divide-by-zero error or an illegal instruction.

In many programming languages, exception handling is implemented using a try-catch-finally block. The try block contains the code that may throw an exception, the catch block contains the code that handles the exception, and the finally block contains optional cleanup code that is always executed.

Exception handling is an important aspect of programming because it allows a program to gracefully recover from errors and continue execution. It can also help to improve the reliability and stability of a program by allowing it to handle exceptional conditions in a predictable and controlled manner.

An interrupt is a signal that is sent to the processor to interrupt the normal flow of instructions. Interrupts are typically generated by external devices, such as keyboards or timers, or by internal events, such as a divide-by-zero error.

Interrupts are an important mechanism for handling external events and for allowing multiple tasks to be performed concurrently in a computer system. Interrupts are typically handled by the operating system (OS), which determines the appropriate action to take in response to the interrupt.

Exception handling and interrupts are related because both involve the handling of exceptional conditions. Exception handling is typically used to handle errors that are encountered during the normal execution of a program, while interrupts are used to handle external events and to allow multiple tasks to be performed concurrently.
