**Statistics** is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation,
presentation, and organization of data. It is a branch of mathematics
that is used to draw conclusions from data and to make predictions based
on statistical models.

The **scope of statistics** includes the design of statistical studies,
the collection and analysis of data, and the interpretation of results.
It is used in a wide range of fields, including business, economics,
psychology, biology, and computer science.

There are several **types of data** that can be collected and analyzed
in statistics, including:

-  **Numerical data**: Numerical data is data that can be measured or
   quantified, such as height, weight, or temperature. There are two
   types of numerical data: continuous data, which can take any value
   within a given range, and discrete data, which can only take certain
   values.

-  **Categorical data**: Categorical data is data that can be placed
   into categories or groups, such as gender, race, or political party.

-  **Ordinal data**: Ordinal data is data that can be ranked or ordered,
   but the differences between the values may not be equal.

There are several different **methods of data collection**, including:

-  **Experiments**: Experiments involve manipulating one or more
   variables and observing the effect on one or more outcomes.

-  **Surveys**: Surveys involve collecting data from a sample of
   individuals using methods such as questionnaires or interviews.

-  **Observational studies**: Observational studies involve observing
   and recording data without manipulating variables.

**Measures of central tendency** are statistical measures that describe
the center or average of a distribution. The three most common measures
of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.

The **mean** is the arithmetic average of a set of data. It is
calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of
values.

The **median** is the middle value in a set of data. It is the value
that divides the data into two equal parts.

The **mode** is the most frequently occurring value in a set of data.

**Dispersion** is a measure of the spread or variability of a
distribution. Common measures of dispersion include the range, variance,
and standard deviation.

**Probability** is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring.
It is a number between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the event is
impossible and 1 indicating that the event is certain.

A **random variable** is a variable whose value is determined by the
outcome of a random event. There are two types of random variables:
discrete random variables, which can take on a finite or countably
infinite number of values, and continuous random variables, which can
take on any value within a given range.

A **probability distribution** is a function that describes the
likelihood of different values occurring for a random variable. The most
common probability distributions are the binomial distribution, the
normal distribution, and the Poisson distribution.
