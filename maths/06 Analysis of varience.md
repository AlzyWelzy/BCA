# Analysis of Variance

**Analysis of variance (ANOVA)** is a statistical method used to compare the means of two or more groups. It is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the groups, and to identify which groups are significantly different from one another.

There are several types of ANOVA, including:

- **One-way ANOVA**: One-way ANOVA is a statistical method used to compare the means of two or more groups when there is only one independent variable. It is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the groups, and to identify which groups are significantly different from one another.

- **Two-way ANOVA**: Two-way ANOVA is a statistical method used to compare the means of two or more groups when there are two independent variables. It is used to determine whether there is a significant interaction between the two variables, and to identify which groups are significantly different from one another.

ANOVA is an important statistical tool that is used to compare the means of different groups. It is widely used in statistical analysis and has many practical applications in the real world.
