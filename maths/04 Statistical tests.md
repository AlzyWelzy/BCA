# Statistical tests

**Statistical tests** are procedures that are used to evaluate statistical hypotheses. They involve comparing a sample of data to a theoretical model or to a reference distribution in order to determine whether the data is consistent with the model or the distribution.

There are several types of statistical tests, including:

- **Z-test and t-test**: Z-tests and t-tests are statistical tests that are used to compare the mean of a sample to a reference value. Z-tests are used when the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known, while t-tests are used when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown.

- **ANOVA and chi-square test**: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and the chi-square test are statistical tests that are used to compare the means of two or more groups. ANOVA is used when the groups have continuous data and the variances are equal, while the chi-square test is used when the groups have categorical data.

- **Non-parametric tests**: Non-parametric tests are statistical tests that do not assume that the data follows a particular distribution. They are used when the data is not normally distributed or when the sample size is small. Examples of non-parametric tests include the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Statistical tests are an important tool in statistical analysis because they allow researchers to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. They are used to evaluate hypotheses about the population mean, variance, or proportions, and to compare the means or proportions of different groups.
